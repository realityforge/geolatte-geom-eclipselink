# geolatte-geom-eclipselink

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/realityforge/geolatte-geom-eclipselink.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/realityforge/geolatte-geom-eclipselink)

[Geolatte](http://www.geolatte.org/) is a small, focused java GIS project. This library adds
converters for persisting and loading Geolatte types using the Eclipselink jpa provider.

Currently support is restricted to Postgres but it is expected that SQL Server support will
be added in the near future.

NOTE: This was intended to be used for EE6 variant of elipselink. For EE7 and later versions please use
the [geolatte-geom-jpa](https://github.com/realityforge/geolatte-geom-jpa) project.

## Usage

The user should be able to use any of the Geolatte spatial types within a persistent entity. The
user then just needs to specify the session event listener. This can be set using a property in the
persistent.xml file using a section such as;

    <properties>
      <property name="eclipselink.session-event-listener" value="org.realityforge.jeo.geolatte.jpa.eclipselink.GeolatteExtension"/>
    </properties>
